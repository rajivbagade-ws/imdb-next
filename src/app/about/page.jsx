        IMDb (an initialism for Internet Movie Database)[2] is an online
        database of information related to films, television series, podcasts,
        home videos, video games, and streaming content online â€“ including cast,
        production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia,
        ratings, and fan and critical reviews. IMDb began as a fan-operated
        movie database on the Usenet group "rec.arts.movies" in 1990, and moved
        to the Web in 1993. Since 1998, it has been owned and operated by
        IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon.

        The site's message boards were disabled in February 2017. As of 2019,
        IMDb was the 52nd most visited website on the Internet, as ranked by
        Alexa.[3] As of March 2022, the database contained some 10.1 million
        titles (including television episodes), 11.5 million person records, and
        83 million registered users.[4]

        The title and talent pages of IMDb are accessible to all users, but only
        registered and logged-in users can submit new material and suggest edits
        to existing entries. Most of the site's data has been provided by these
        volunteers. Registered users with a proven track record are able to add
        and make corrections to cast lists, credits, and some other data points.
        However, the addition and removal of images, and alterations to titles,
        cast and crew names, character names, and plot summaries are subject to
        an approval process; this usually takes between 24 and 72 hours.
